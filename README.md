# diabetes_ann_prediction.ipynb
This project develops a binary classification model to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on medical diagnostic measurements.  A feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated using multiple optimizers to compare performance.
